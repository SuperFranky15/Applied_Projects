Description: advertising and sales data by ASIN, by country, by day for 2022.

ASIN: VARCHAR Amazon sales identification number. Similar to a SKU or UPC.
VENDOR_ID: INTEGER Brand identification internal to Pattern
COUNTRY_CODE: VARCHAR Code of country of sale. E.g., US = United States. Full dictionary for codes can be provided if needed.
ORDERING_REGION: VARCHAR Code of region of shared inventory. E.g., EU = European Union, as inventory held in Germany can be sold in France.
DATE: DATE Date of sale OR date of click. Most sales for a click occur on the day of the click, but there can be a delay. E.g., an attributed sale, but no total sales that day.
TOTAL_REV: FLOAT Total revenue of units sold for that ASIN, country_code, date.
TOTAL_UNITS: INTEGER Total units sold for that ASIN, country_code, date.
ATTR_REV: FLOAT Revenue that came as a consequence of clicking on an Ad as claimed by Amazon. Major caveats here: 1) if a customer clicks on your ad and buys ANY product from your company that unit / revenue will be counted as part of attribution. 2) Attribution continues for 7 days. 3) If a customer clicks an ad and would have purchased your product anyway (e.g., ad is shown in first slot and identical listing with same product is shown organically in second slot).
ATTR_UNITS: INTEGER Same description as ATTR_REV but units sold.
